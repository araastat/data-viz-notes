# Preamble {.unnumbered}

This online book is a compilation of lecture notes and supplements used in various data visualization courses I have taught over the years. The primary material comes from the materials in [ANLY 503](https://anly503.netlify.app) @ Georgetown University, co-developed with [Marck Vaisman](https://www.github.com/wahalulu) over several years. Other resources include [BIOF 439](https://www.araastat.com/BIOF439) and [BIOF 440](https://www.araastat.com/BIOF440), courses I taught at FAES @ NIH.

These notes are a distillation of several conceptual ideas promoted by researchers, graphic designers, journalists and data scientists, as well as my own experiences. People who influenced my thinking on this topic include Jeff Heer, Tamara Munzner, Nathan Yau, Jon Schwabish, and the excellent teams at the New York Times, Guardian, Financial Times and the BBC.

Many examples in these notes are reflective of efforts of the greater R and Python data visualization communities, especially participants in the amazing [Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) community activity, students and colleagues who have inspired me with their innovation and visual design.
